This is a java app I wrote to get the data for the larger data set and make the labels, as well as the data and labels I got with it.  It includes the Jaunt webscraping package, the source code for the app, and three data files.  

The largest data file is the raw json delivered by the restful endpoint.  The smaller json file is a summary of each record including the diagnosis, large image filename, and label for each record.  The small csv file is just the record number, image filename, and label for each record.  I hope these formats will be useful.  

This is my first time getting data like this and sending a pull request, sorry for any mistakes I make in the process.
